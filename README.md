## Description

In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.

Here the final result:

***This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.***

## Requirements

* You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
* You are not to use Javascript

## Tasks

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](README.md)

For this task, please write an amazing README.md

### [1. Header](0-styles.css)

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
* Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: **create the header/hero piece**

### [2. "What we do..." section](1-styles.css)

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: **create the “What we do…” section**

**Important:** try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

### [3. "Our results" section](2-styles.css)

For this third task: **create the “Our results” section**

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

### [4. Contact us](3-styles.css)

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### [5. Footer](4-styles.css)

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:
